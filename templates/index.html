                stop using the service. Reducing churn is vital for telecom companies as it leads to increased revenue, 
                customer retention, and a competitive advantage in the industry.

            <h3>About the Classifier</h3>
            <p>
                This classifier is designed to predict customer churn based on multiple factors, including customer 
                demographics, service usage, and payment history. By understanding which customers are likely to churn, 
                telecom providers can take proactive steps to retain them.
